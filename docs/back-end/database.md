## Database Setup

### Create the Models

In order to create a model

### Connect to the Database from Python

For this project, the database requires a secret password that is on the server,
so that the server can connect. We specify inside of `models.py` the remaining
specifications such as user name, database name and database location.

### Populate the Database

In `models.py`, I wrote a few functions that populate the database. In fact, you
can execute `models.py` on the command line, wait a few minutes, and the
database will be full with data.
